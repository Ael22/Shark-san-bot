# Shark-san Bot
Shark-san is a utility discord bot that aims to make the server better and more lively without the use of many different bots. At the moment there is only a few commands and will add more in the future when i learn more about code.

## Instructions
As the bot is not hosted 24/7, you can download the repository to try out the bot first. 

First you would need to get a bot key from [Discord Developer portal](https://discord.com/developers)

1. Clone the repository 
2. Go to ``index.js`` 
3. Go to the bottom of `index.js` and replace `YOUR TOKEN` with your discord developer bot key.
4. Open the terminal and run `node .` to start the bot.

Now that the bot is online, you can invite it to your server with the help of this [link](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html)
